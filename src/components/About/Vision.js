          <h3> AI for Data Modernization</h3>
          <p>
            The journey of AI starts with data. Reinventing data management by
            augmenting the intelligence of Data Teams. Simplifying the data
            supply chain ecosystem for businesses and enable them with usable,
            contextual and trustworthy data of high standards. An intelligence

          <h3>AI-as-a-Product</h3>
          <p>
            We hear enterprises say that POCs proved the concept very well but
            not sure if it is not production grade or production environment
            needs an upgrade. Some enterprises have more pilots than some of the
            largest airplane companies. Simplifying the Labsâ€“Factory-Store
            supply chain for embedded AI business solutions. Enabling businesses
            to build sensible, responsible, scalable and sustainable AI.

          <h3>AI Experience Design</h3>
          <p>
            In the pursuit of technology adoption and automation, enterprises
            often tend to discount process and stakeholder experience redesign.
            AI solution fails to create traction in the stakeholder/user
            community, suffers adoption and hence fails to deliver promised
            impact. Simplifying the lifecycle of Business Problem to Solution
            using a design and discovery canvas

          <h3>AI Governance</h3>
          <p>
            Behavior of AI systems in Production should be under the control of
            humans. Collecting behavioral patterns of all the layers of an AI
            system and identifying symptoms is crucial. Simplifying AI system
            observability, actionability and close looping to ensure AI embedded
            solutions becomes a norm in Enterprise System Architecture.
